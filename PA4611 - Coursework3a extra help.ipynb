    "10% of mark. The SPH kernel. Implement and demonstrate using a plot and brief explanation.  \n",
    "50% of mark. Create a 1D simulation of the shock tube. You have been initial conditions other than smoothing length, which you can chose yourself, but my first suggestion would be 0.005  \n",
    "20% of mark. Alter properties of your simulation and explain what you have done and its results.  \n",
    "20% of mark. Add artificial viscosity to your simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In each case 50% of the marks are for correct numerical results (partially correct results get partial marks). 40% are for your explanation of this results (including well chosen, well plotted graphs). 10% are for good coding (clear, commented, not too repetitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize part of this, **40% are for your explanations**. So all parts of the notebook need an explanation of what you have done, and the results you get. These should be given in markdown boxes around the code.\n"
