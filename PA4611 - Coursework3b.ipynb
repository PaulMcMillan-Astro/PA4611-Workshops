    "The code is in the course Github repository and can be copied from there. The main ways to do that would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the command line: \n",
    "    - If you have not used git to get a copy of the course repository then `git clone https://github.com/PaulMcMillan-Astro/PA4611-Workshops.git` or, if you really know what you're doing `git clone git@github.com:PaulMcMillan-Astro/PA4611-Workshops.git`\n",
    "    - If you have already cloned the repository then you can just `git pull` to get the latest version.\n",
    "2. Using the web interface: go to the repository and download the zip file. (You will need to click on the button saying 'Code' to download the zip file.)\n",
    "    - You will need to unzip the file and move the directory to where you want it to be (ideally the directory this notebook is in).\n",
    "3. From Blackboard. I have put the zip file `ulula.zip`, which I will aim to keep fully up-to-date. You should download this and unzip it in the directory where you want to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to use the lines of code using `sys.path' to make sure the notebook can use the Ulula code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make Ulula work you need the usual packages (numpy, scipy & matplotlib) and h5py and six. You can install these using conda install or pip install."

    "\n",
    "You will use the Ulula code to investigate how this instability develops in a 2D grid. The code allows you to set-up and run the code in a variety of ways, and you should experiment with different parameters to see how the instability develops."
